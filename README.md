I. HOW TO USE THE CODE

1. Clone the project using: git clone

2. Run the Program.cs file in the Pi-Estimator folder.

3. There's your Pi(e)!

The question is simple: Say you have a random function, that generate a random number from 0 to 1. Given that the function is evenly distributed, calculate the number Pi.
Now, it may sound quite random, but there's actually a mathematical method to tackle this problem.
